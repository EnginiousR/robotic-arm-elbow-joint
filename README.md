# Robotic Arm Elbow Joint â€“ Onshape Design

This repository contains the 3D CAD design for a robotic arm elbow joint, modeled using Onshape. The design is intended for use in robotic systems and can be 3D printed or further modified in CAD software.

## Overview

- Designed in: Onshape
- Purpose: Elbow joint component for a modular robotic arm
- Features:
  - Four mounting holes on the base for secure attachment
  - Two side holes to allow shaft or rotational pin insertion
  - Rounded contours to support smooth rotation and aesthetics
  - 3D printable and SolidWorks-compatible formats included

## Files

| File Name | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `elbow_joint.stl` | STL | Ready for 3D printing |
| `elbow_joint.sldprt` | SolidWorks Part | Editable CAD file for modification |
| `elbow_joint_top_view.png` | Image | Top view of the elbow joint |
| `elbow_joint_side_view.png` | Image | Side view showing pin hole |
| `elbow_joint_front_view.png` | Image | Front view showing full thickness and hole arrangement |

## Usage

### 3D Printing
- Open the `elbow_joint.stl` file in any slicing software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer)
- Recommended print orientation: flat on the base with support as needed
- Material: PLA, PETG, or ABS depending on mechanical strength requirements

### CAD Modification
- Open `elbow_joint.sldprt` in SolidWorks (or import into Fusion 360 via compatible format)
- Use this file for:
  - Parametric edits
  - Customization of dimensions
  - Assembly with other robotic components
